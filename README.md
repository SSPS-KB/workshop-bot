## Configuration
Most of this project's configuration is self-explanatory if you ever set up a discord bot.
The project looks in current directory for `Config.toml` and if there is no configuration it checks `/etc/workshop-bot`.
If running in docker, you'll want to either add a volume to `/app/Config.toml` or even better add a whole folder to
`/etc/workshop-bot`.

Instead of using names, the bot is using IDs to find channels.

### Discord token (discord_token)
This is the only required value, it is used to authenticate with discord. NEVER SHARE IT WITH ANYONE.
To get it create a bot on https://discord.com/developers. If you don't know how to do that, search "How to create a
discord bot", it has been explained over thousand times.

### Workshop invite channel (workshop_invite_channel)
This configuration option is basically useless. It's used to create and log an invite at the bot's startup.  
It's only used for the invite to look more professional.
